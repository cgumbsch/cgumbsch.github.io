            <p> I am fascinated by the question of how humans and other animals learn adaptive goal-directed behavior from their experience. My research goal is to help the development of autonomous embodied agents with a similar skillset. To work towards this goal, I follow two research directions: </p>
            <br>
                    <p> <b>1. AI research:</b> I research inductive biases and computational mechanisms that improve the autonomous learning and problem-solving capabilities of artificial agents.  This includes, for example, research on temporal abstractions, world models, and intrinsic motivation. </p>
            <br>
                    <p> <b>2. Cognitive modeling:</b> I employ similar methods for computational cognitive models to research the mechanisms and representations that give rise to the adaptive behavior found in natural agents. This includes modeling epistemic gaze behavior and multimodal speech processing. </p>
            <br>
                    <p> As you can probably tell, I have a broad research interest in various topic including reinforcement learning, hierarchical planning, multimodal representation learning, and causal discovery in both natural and artificial intelligence. </p>
